Prompt
======
Create this single page scrolling layout using either of the two technology stacks

html/css/js/jQuery
haml/SaSS/js (or coffeescript)/jQuery

This should be built exclusively using one of the two sets of tools above,
and should not rely on any additional libraries or frameworks.


Browser Compatibility
=====================
This layout should work in ie8+ as well as on tablet devices
and the most recent versions of Firefox, Chrome and Safari.
If you do not have access to a particular browser, we recommend a
service such as Browser Stack.

Top Navigation
==============
Top navigation is 100% width, with a set height.
This site is *not* responsive, so its layout is centered, and
measurements are as given in the .psd.

Navigation items, here must be laid out and "sticky" (always
staying at the top of the window), but nothing needs to be clickable/
functional within the element

Background
==========
The background image should always fill the screen and be center anchored.

Interior Content
================
Content inside the page should be layed out as shown, and scroll
down to show more content. All text outside of that associated with the pie chart
should be live type. If you do not have the fonts used in the document (assumed that you do not)
any font may be substituted with arial for the purpose of this exercise.

Lightbox
========
The lightbox should launch whenever any one of the white circles with the arrow
in it is clicked. The content here can be static and always open the same lightbox,
OR it can change based on the arrow clicked (use Lorem Ipsum), it is up to you.

This lightbox should be styled and coded from scratch without the use of any plugins,
libraries or tools other than those listed above.
